## Problem Description

The problem is to develop a Traffic-sign recognition system which can recognize the traffic signs put up on the road e.g. "speed limit" or "children" or "turn ahead" etc. Given the traffic signs in the image form as input, the problem is to recognize the signs using Machine learning techniques. To solve the problem following are provided:
